# Robot modeling

In this week we were assigned to investigate different subject regarding robot moldeing in ROS and Gazebo, and as a final assignment for this week we were asked to model two identical links that simulate light sensors.

## Xacro, URDF and SDF

These three XML representations are used for describing different aspects of 3D environments such as robots, sensors, objects, etc. The raison d'Ãªtre of each one of them, beside the specification-differences and some limitations of some of them in relation to other ones, is the context in which each one is used.

`Xacro` is used for defining the final `URDF` file that will be used for describing the robot inside ROS. It's not convenient writing directly the `URDF` file because the `Xacro` files have tools that allow to write more modularized and reusable code, such as **macros** and file-including with invoking parameters, which allows us to avoid copy-pasting long blocks of code. So, if we want to describe a 3D model of a robot, the usual way is to write the `.xacro` file and then execute it with the corresponding `.launch` file, which in turn will execute a `.cpp` or `.py` file which will convert the `.xacro` file into a `.urdf` file.

`SDF` files have a lot more descriptive-power than `URDF` files. They can specify things that are not robots, such as lights, scenes, worlds, etc. Also, they can specify physical properties that a `URDF` cannot, such as friction, viscous damping coefficientes, etc.

Aside from all that, `SDF` files are the files used for creating 3D object and scenes inside the Gazebo simulator.

### Conversion between languages with terminal commands


```console
gz sdf -p prueba.urdf > prueba.sdf
```

```console
create@galatea:/create_ws/src/create_autonomy/ca_description/urdf$ xacro create_2.xacro visualize:="true" > prueba.urdf 
xacro: Traditional processing is deprecated. Switch to --inorder processing!
To check for compatibility of your document, use option --check-order.
For more infos, see http://wiki.ros.org/xacro#Processing_Order
```

### Check_urdf

```console
create@galatea:/create_ws/src/create_autonomy/ca_description/urdf$ check_urdf prueba.urdf 
robot name is: create_2
